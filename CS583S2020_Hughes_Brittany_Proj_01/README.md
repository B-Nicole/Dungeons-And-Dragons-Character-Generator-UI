Objective: To create a working UI to generate a DnD character 

Challenges: 
Figuring out the singleton and how to store the users choice 

Process: 
I began by blocking out the basic layout of the game in my sketchbook. This helped me generate the overall flow. I then began to 
make basic scenes in Unity. The buttons contained plain text and a simple black background. I used the Bracky's tutorial for 
scene changing to wire the buttons to each scene. For the rolls I used the list data structure to store each of the five rolls 
taking the sum of the highest three while adding  a +2 modfyer. 
Once I had the basic layout I began to work on the art in clip studio paint. I exported each image in png format with 
a transparent background. I then transferred each image onto a button. For the background I grabbed a random one from google images. 
For the Json file while I was able to get it to output I was not able to copy and paste it. When I tried to tinker with it, the button to
generate the file disappeared so I decided to leave it be before I break something. 

What I learned: 
How to make a UI
The original idea you have could turn out completely different at the end stage. 
Have a list of tasks needed to be completed 
Buttons are time cosuming....but great for art
