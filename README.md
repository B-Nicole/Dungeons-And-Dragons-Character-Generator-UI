# Dungeons and Dragons Character UI
### Author: Brittany Hughes 
### Art: Brittany Hughes (except the background)

Objective: To create a working UI that generates a DnD character

Challenges: Figuring out the singleton and how to store the users choice

### Process:  
<p>I began by blocking out the basic layout of the game in my sketchbook which helped me generate the overall flow. <br> I then began to flesh out the basic scenes in Unity. The buttons contained plain text and a simple black background.</p> <p>I used a tutorial from Brackys- [Bracky's tutorial](https://youtu.be/CE9VOZivb3I) - for scene changing to wire the buttons to each scene. <br> For the rolls I used the list data structure to store each of the five rolls taking the sum of the highest three while adding a +2 modfyer. Once I had the basic layout I began to work on the art in [clip studio paint.](https://www.clipstudio.net/en/)<br></p> <p>I exported each image in PNG format with a transparent background. I then transferred each image onto a button. For the background I grabbed one from google images. For the Json file, while I was able to get it to output I was not able to copy and paste it. When I tried to tinker with it, the button to generate the file disappeared so I decided to leave it for the time being.</p>

### What I learned: 
- How to break up a task in stages writing out ideas then fleshing them out to meat a goal. 
- Connecting buttons for scene transitions
- Visual art
